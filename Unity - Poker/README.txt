Poker README

// This project is still in development.

This Unity project is a poker game I've been working
on as a break from working on "Cops and Robbers".
Like with "Cops and Robbers", the goal of starting
this project was to become more comfortable and skilled
with multiplayer configurations in Unity.

The game is an average Texas Hold 'Em poker game one would 
expect to find; players are dealt two cards and take turns
betting as three cards, followed by one and lastly another
one, are laid on the table in order to make the best five-
card hand out of seven cards. At the end of this betting
process, the game will determine the best hand of the
players still in the current hand, and afterwards a new hand
will begin.

To introduce some flavor and quirkiness to the game and
separate it from the "average poker game", I plan to add
other aspects to the base of the game after its completing.
Among them, as an example, I plan to add "cheats" of a
comedic degree that would be interesting and fun to use,
yet would also provide a fair level of risk; with the goal
of keeping the game probability-based without artificial
influence, the cheats will be designed to offer help with
as much probability as offering harm (as opposed to strictly
helping the player). As stated, my hope is that this among
other additions will make the game fun and more light-hearted
to play.

<TODO>
The next step in building this game is to write the methodology
and logic that determines which player has the winning hand.
After this is done, the addition of a monetary system is all that
remains before the game is "done". Yet, as I stated, I have more
plans for this game beyond the basics.
