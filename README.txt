Project Repository README
@Zach Janice

This GitHub repository contians some examples of my
recent work, consisting mainly of independent projects
and experiments but also of a group project I worked on
as a part of one of my classes. Descriptions and notes
on each project can be found in the README file in each
project folder. Depending on the project's completeness
and ability to be run/demonstrated, in each folder the 
corresponding project will be available as either an
executable file or as a collection of images and
screenshots.

While the code is provided for these projects, the
cumulative project files are available upon request.
This mainly pertains to "Cops and Robbers" and "Poker",
since these projects were constructed using Unity and
remain in development.
