Here is all the information you need to know about the different towers:


(Key 1) THREAD TOWER: This tower is the simplest tower,attacking a single 
virus at a moderate rate.

(Key 2) GLITCH TOWER: This tower stuns viruses that it hits, dealing a 
reduced amount of damage but temporarily stopping the viruses in place.

(Key 3) GARBAGE COLLECTION TOWER: This tower reclaims RAM from dead viruses 
whose processes have ended, giving bonus credits for the purchase of towers 
to the player when a Collection Tower deals the killing blow to a virus.

(Key 4) PROCESS MODERATOR TOWER: This tower monitors and equalizes the 
healths of the viruses passing through by prioritizing the virus in its 
range with the highest health.

(Key 5) PROCESS TERMINATOR TOWER: This tower picks off and ends specific 
viruses by prioritizing the virus in its range with the lowest health.

(Key 6) BREAK TOWER: This tower snipes viruses from afar, dealing a high 
amount of damage at a very high range at the cost of a long time period in 
between shots.

(Key 7) WIPE TOWER: This tower aims at the middle of its targeted group and 
deals raid area-of-effect damage in a small radius.

(Key 8) LAG TOWER: This tower emits pulses of lag, slowing viruses that are 
hit by the pulse. Viruses that are glitched will ignire this pulse.

(Key 9) MEMORY TOWER: This tower recalls its attacking process in memory as 
it attacks in rapid succession, allowing the tower to reduce its cooldown 
progressively so long as an in-range virus exists for it when it's ready to 
attack.

(Key 0) LOAD TOWER: This tower fires a massive processing load onto nearby 
viruses, dealing a massive amount of damage that is divided evenly among all 
viruses hit.
